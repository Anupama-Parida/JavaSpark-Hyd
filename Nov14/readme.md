### Getting started with React
This is a small React practice project created using Vite.<br>
I'm experimenting with basic React rendering, including using React.createElement directly<br>
and modifying the default Vite setup. The project includes a simple setup with App.jsx, main.jsx,<br>
and an index.html file where I tested rendering a custom “Hello from react ” heading.<br>
It’s mainly for learning and trying out React concepts like rendering, components, and how Vite bundles the app.
