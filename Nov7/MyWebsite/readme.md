This project is a practice exercise where I designed a simple homepage for a bakery called Sweet Delights.
The page includes sections for products, delivery information, and contact details.
It was built using HTML and CSS, focusing on layout design, color coordination, and responsive structure. 
This task helped me improve my skills in creating aesthetically pleasing static web pages and practicing webpage structure.
