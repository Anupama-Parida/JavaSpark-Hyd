This project is a simple yet functional student registration form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The form collects essential student information such as name, age, email, gender, and course selection.
Upon clicking the register button, the entered details are displayed dynamically on the same page, providing immediate feedback.
The layout is clean and intuitive, with an aesthetic pastel color scheme for a modern and user-friendly interface.
This project helped reinforce concepts of form handling, DOM manipulation, and basic JavaScript interactivity.
